LAYER 10 ATTENTION OUTPUT DISRUPTION - CAUSAL REPORT
======================================================================

## HYPOTHESIS
Disrupting Layer 10's attention output to reduce BEGIN influence
should CAUSE the decimal comparison bug in the correct format.

## RESULTS

✅ CAUSAL RELATIONSHIP CONFIRMED!
Successful disruption modes: reduce_begin, scramble_begin, inject_buggy
  • reduce_begin: Bug induced at 70% disruption
  • scramble_begin: Bug induced at 100% disruption
  • inject_buggy: Bug induced at 100% disruption

## DETAILED RESULTS BY MODE

### inject_buggy
   0%: CORRECT

  70%: CORRECT
  90%: CORRECT
  100%: BUG

## IMPLICATIONS
1. Layer 10 attention output IS causally responsible for the bug
2. Reducing BEGIN influence in attention output causes the bug
3. The attention output difference is the mechanism
4. This validates the attention output patching results
